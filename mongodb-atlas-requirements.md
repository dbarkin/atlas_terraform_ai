| TC-3 | GCP Services | Limited to GCP services available in NORTH_AMERICA_NORTHEAST_1 and NORTH_AMERICA_NORTHEAST_2 regions |
| TC-4 | GitHub Actions | GitHub-hosted runners for the CI/CD pipeline |

## 5. Implementation Approach

### 5.1 Terraform Modules Structure

```
├── modules/
│   ├── atlas-project/
│   ├── atlas-cluster/
│   ├── atlas-user/
│   ├── atlas-network/
│   └── gcp-resources/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── test/
│   └── prod/
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── main.tf
```

### 5.2 GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: MongoDB Atlas Terraform

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      
      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init
        
      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate
        
      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan
        
      - name: Terraform Apply
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```
