## 1. Project Plan Overview

### 1.1 Phases

1. **Initiation and Planning**  
   - **Objective:** Finalize scope, define stakeholders, and establish the project team.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - Review functional and non-functional requirements (FR-1.x to FR-5.x, NFR-1.x to NFR-6.x).  
     - Identify project stakeholders (DevOps engineers, security team, DBAs, application developers).  
     - Define high-level milestones, budget, and success criteria.

2. **Design and Architecture**  
   - **Objective:** Finalize the Terraform module structure, GitHub Actions workflow design, and network/security architecture.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - Design the Terraform module layout (e.g., `atlas-project`, `atlas-cluster`, `atlas-network`, etc.).  
     - Define environment-specific configurations (dev, test, prod).  
     - Validate network settings (private endpoints, IP access lists, VPC peering).  
     - Outline CI/CD pipeline steps (init, plan, approval, apply).  
     - Confirm security and compliance requirements (API keys, encryption, access management).  
     - Document design decisions.

3. **Implementation**  
   - **Objective:** Build and configure the Terraform modules, GitHub Actions pipelines, and supporting infrastructure.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - Set up Terraform state backend on GCP (FR-5.2, FR-5.3).  
     - Implement Terraform modules for:  
       - MongoDB Atlas Project and Cluster (FR-3.x requirements)  
       - Authentication, roles, DB users (FR-1.x)  
       - Private endpoints, IP access lists, VPC peering (FR-2.x)  
       - Backup/Disaster Recovery configuration (FR-4.x)  
     - Configure GitHub Actions:  
       - Store secrets securely (NFR-1.1, NFR-1.2)  
       - Stages for Terraform format, validate, plan, apply (NFR-5.1, NFR-5.3)  
       - Approval gate for production (NFR-5.2)  
     - Parameterize environment variables (cluster size, environment selection).  
     - Implement best practices for code documentation and naming conventions (NFR-6.x).

4. **Testing and Validation**  
   - **Objective:** Ensure the solution meets functional and non-functional requirements through various tests.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - **Functional Testing:**  
       - Validate cluster deployment, region placement, replica set configuration.  
       - Verify network connectivity (private endpoints, IP access lists).  
       - Confirm backup and restore (RTO and RPO compliance).  
     - **Non-Functional Testing:**  
       - **Performance Load Test:** Assess cluster performance under simulated high-traffic conditions; analyze throughput and latency.  
       - **Penetration Test:** Evaluate system security posture; identify and remediate vulnerabilities in network configuration, access controls, and CI/CD pipeline.  
       - Security checks (no sensitive data in logs, restricted networks).  
       - Scalability tests (resizing cluster, disk auto-scaling).  
       - CI/CD pipeline rollback testing (NFR-5.4).  
       - Performance monitoring and logging tests.  
     - **Approvals and Sign-Off:**  
       - Stakeholder review of test results.  
       - Final sign-off by security and DBA teams.

5. **Deployment and Handover**  
   - **Objective:** Move the tested infrastructure into production and transition to operations.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - Execute production deployment through GitHub Actions with approval gates.  
     - Update and finalize documentation (user guides, runbooks).  
     - Conduct knowledge transfer sessions for operations and support teams.  
     - Establish ongoing monitoring, logging, and alerting processes.  
     - Schedule periodic security reviews and environment health checks.

6. **Post-Implementation Review**  
   - **Objective:** Assess project performance, lessons learned, and compliance with success criteria.  
   - **Key Tasks:**  
     - Evaluate success metrics (SC-1 to SC-5).  
     - Document lessons learned (what went well, areas for improvement).  
     - Create a final project closure report.

## 5. Conclusion

By following this phased project plan and delivering each of the major artifacts, the team will satisfy the functional (FR-1.x to FR-5.x) and non-functional (NFR-1.x to NFR-6.x) requirements. The comprehensive approach—enhanced by performance load tests and penetration tests—ensures the deployed MongoDB Atlas infrastructure on GCP meets security, reliability, and scalability standards. This framework also provides clear guidance for implementing, testing, and maintaining the solution, ultimately enabling a robust and future-proof environment for applications dependent on MongoDB.
